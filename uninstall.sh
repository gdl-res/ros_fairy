# (spool/state/log), and the ros_fairy Python package itself — the reverse of
# install.sh + `ros2 fairy setup`.
#
# Deliberately NOT removed: your saved missions. /var/ros-fairy/archive (the
# RO-Crate bags + metadata) and /var/ros-fairy/index.db are left in place.
# This script only reminds you where they are; delete them yourself if you

# Usage: ./uninstall.sh [-y|--yes]

# ros_fairy/subcommands/setup.py's SERVICE_NAME/GROUP_NAME and
# ros_fairy/utils/paths.py's DEFAULT_CONFIG_DIR/DEFAULT_VAR_DIR.
